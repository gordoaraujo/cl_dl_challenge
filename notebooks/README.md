# Notebooks folder

To minimise merging conflicts, I will suggest that we create notebooks that start with our names, so we know what belongs to who (i.e. `Jose_here_is_the_crazy_analysis.ipynb`) However, if we push and pull constantly then we will always have each others code that you can quickly check without copy-pasting.
